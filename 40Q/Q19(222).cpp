    // Q19(Unsolved)
    // Inspired by a "Little Bishops" problem, Petya now wants to solve problem for rooks.

    // A rook is a piece used in the game of chess which is played on a board of square grids. A rook can only move horizontally and vertically from its current position and two rooks attack each other if one is on the path of the other.

    // Given two numbers n and k, your job is to determine the number of ways one can put k rooks on an n × n chessboard so that no two of them are in attacking positions.

    // Input

    // The input file contains two integers n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) and k (0 ≤ k ≤ n2).

    // Output

    // Print a line containing the total number of ways one can put the given number of rooks on a chessboard of the given size so that no two of them are in attacking positions.

    // Sample test(s)

    // Input
    // 4 4

    // Output
    // 24    





    // Answer:
    // int n, k;
    // cout << "Enter the value of n: ";
    // cin >> n;
    // cout << "Enter the value of k: ";
    // cin >> k;
    // int arr[n][n];
    // int count = 0;
    // bool unique = true;

    // for (int i = 0; i < n; i++){
    //     for (int j = 0; j < n; j++){
    //         arr[i][j] = 0;
    //     }
    // }



    return 0;
